Assumptions
---
* For every Heartbeat the sell will stop on first come first serve basis
* Instead of comment I have tried writing code in such a way that the code is self explanatory
* Bid are always received in incremental order i.e. if i receive a bid amount 7 then next bid amount will be always equal or greater then 7
